          <h1>Finding true value in college</h1>
          <p>It's not difficult to find the cost of tuition at any given college. What's not as easy to find is the actual cost a college's students are paying, how much debt they are accumulating, and how much they earn after graduating. All of these factors contribute to the true value of a college and are factors in choosing a school to attend.</p>
